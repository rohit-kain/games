In this repo, I would be pushing some games that i have coded using any programming language.
The first game I have developed is a tic tac toe game,that we all must have played in our childhood.
### STEPS TO PLAY
1.This game would be played between 2 people 
2.player 1 and player 2 have to choose what their input gonna be, player1 will choose 1 and player 2 will choose 2.
3.In the End winner would be annoounced.
